# INET4031 - Module 6 - Working with Remote Systems

## Instructions, files, code for Lab 6.

What if you aren't nearby the computer you need to work on?  Let's learn how to use SSH to remote into a remote server.

Up until this point, our Lab activities have been accomplished by doing them on our laptops.

In this activity we explore the concept of "servers."  Which typically aren't located where we are.

We have to connect to them remotely.

This Lab explores that concept.

This lab goes over how to use a remote server and how to host a local website and edit it with HTML and JavaScript.  HTML tells the web browser how to display the website, while JavaScript tells the browser what to do when a user interacts with it.
